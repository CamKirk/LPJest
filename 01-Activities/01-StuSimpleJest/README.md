# What's the spin?

* Preview the tests in spinner.test.js, these are the specifications for the first steps to your spinner function.

* Make sure to install jest using `yarn`.

* Run your tests by running `yarn test` in the folder. This _should_ fail with both tests right now.

* In spinner.js, write the contents of the spinner() function to meet the specifications of the tests.

* Run `yarn test` again to make sure that you meet the test requirements.
