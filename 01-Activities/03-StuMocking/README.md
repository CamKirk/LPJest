# ARE YOU MOCKING ME!?

* Open `main.test.js` and write at least three other non-canary tests for applyOperatorTiny

* What are things that applyOperatorTiny should NOT do? Hints: What would happen if you passed an Array as one of the arguments? What values should randomState never take on?

* Bonus: Improve applyOperatorTiny so that it checks for arrays in the `arr` argument, but DON'T create a new variable to do so.
